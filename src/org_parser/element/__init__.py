"""Greater and lesser element representations.

This subpackage provides Python types that wrap individual tree-sitter nodes
corresponding to Org Mode *elements* — the structural building blocks of an
org document such as paragraphs, plain lists, source blocks, drawers, and
planning entries.

The primary public type is :class:`Element`, a stub that preserves the node
type and verbatim source text.  Per-element semantics will be added in
subsequent iterations.
